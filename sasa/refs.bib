  abstract = "Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) have been proposed as an
              alternative to pluripotent stem cells to study multilineage
              differentiation in vitro and for therapeutic application.
              Standard culture media for isolation and expansion of stem cells
              includes animal sera or animal-derived matrix components (e.g.,
              Matrigel(\textregistered{})). However, animal-derived reagents
              raise significant concerns with respect to the translational
              ability of these cells due to the possibility of infection and/or
              severe immune reaction. For these reasons clinical grade
              substitutes to animal components are needed in order for stem
              cells to reach their full therapeutic potential. In this chapter
              we detail a method for isolation and proliferation of DPSC in a
              chemically defined medium containing a low percentage of human
              serum. We demonstrate that in this defined culture medium a 1.25
              \% human serum component sufficiently replaces fetal bovine
              serum. This method allows for isolation of a morphologically and
              phenotypically uniform population of DPSCs from dental pulp
              tissue. DPSCs represent a rapidly proliferating cell population
              that readily differentiates into the osteoblastic, neuronal,
              myocytic, and hepatocytic lineages. This multilineage capacity of
              these DPSCs suggests that they may have a more broad therapeutic
              application than lineage-restricted adult stem cell populations
              such as mesenchymal stem cells. Further the culture protocol
              presented here makes these cells more amenable to human
              application than current expansion techniques for other
              pluripotent stem cells (embryonic stem cell lines or induced
              pluripotent stem cells).",

  abstract  = "Regenerative medicine allows for the customization of tissues
               and organs which may bring hope to patients with incurable
               diseases and severe injuries. Therefore, reliable and safe
               methods for the generation of specific cell types must be
               established. Recently, different strategies have emerged to
               convert somatic cells into differentiated cells of interest. One
               of these strategies is cellular reprogramming, which converts
               somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These
               iPSCs are embryonic stem cell-like cells with almost unlimited
               developmental potential and can be differentiated into specific
               lineages. Alternatively, the method of transdifferentiation can
               be used to directly convert one terminally differentiated cell
               into another cell type. Both of these methods have proven to
               have the potential to push the field of cell replacement therapy
               forward. In this context, the skin is of particular interest
               because it represents an ideal source of somatic cells for
               reprogramming to pluripotency as well as transdifferentiation.
               In this review, we briefly compare both above-mentioned
               strategies and summarize the latest advances in this highly
               dynamic field of research.",
