              thaliana genome",
  author   = "Takahashi, H and Takahashi, A and Naito, S and Onouchi, H",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are often found
              in the 5' untranslated regions of eukaryotic messenger RNAs. Some
              uORFs have been shown to encode functional peptides involved in
              the translational regulation of the downstream main ORFs.
              Comparative genomic approaches have been employed in genome-wide
              searches for uORFs encoding bioactive peptides, and by comparing
              uORF sequences between a few selected species or among a small
              group of species, uORFs with conserved amino acid sequences have
              been identified in plants, mammals, and insects. Regulatory
              regions within uORF-encoded peptides that are involved in
              translational control are typically 10 to 20 amino acids long.
              Detection of homology between such short regions largely depends
              on the selection of species for comparison. To maximize the
              chances of identifying conserved uORFs with short conserved
              regions, we devised a novel algorithm for homology search among a
              large number of species and the automatic selection of uORFs
              conserved in a wide range of species. RESULTS: In the present
              study, we developed the BAIUCAS (BLAST-based algorithm for
              identification of uORFs with conserved amino acid sequences)
              method, and identified 18 novel Arabidopsis uORFs whose amino
              acid sequences are conserved across diverse eudicot species,
              which include uORFs not found in previous comparative genomic
              studies due to low sequence conservation among species.
              Therefore, BAIUCAS is a powerful method for the identification of
              uORFs with conserved sequences, and it is particularly useful for
              the detection of uORFs with a small number of conserved amino
              acid residues. CONTACT: onouchi@abs.agr.hokudai.ac.jp

  author   = "Tran, John H and Jacoby, George A",
  abstract = "Quinolones are potent antibacterial agents that specifically
              target bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Widespread use
              of these agents has contributed to the rise of bacterial
              quinolone resistance. Previous studies have shown that quinolone
              resistance arises by mutations in chromosomal genes. Recently, a
              multiresistance plasmid was discovered that encodes transferable
              resistance to quinolones. We have cloned the plasmid-quinolone
              resistance gene, termed and found it in an integron-like
              environment upstream from {\O}E{\^\i} and . The gene product Qnr
              was a 218-aa protein belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family
              and shared sequence homology with the immunity protein McbG,
              which is thought to protect DNA gyrase from the action of
              microcin B17. Qnr had pentapeptide repeat domains of 11 and 28
              tandem copies, separated by a single glycine with a consensus
              sequence of A/C D/N L/F X X. Because the primary target of
              quinolones is DNA gyrase in Gram-negative strains, we tested the
              ability of Qnr to reverse the inhibition of gyrase activity by
              quinolones. Purified Qnr-His protected DNA gyrase from inhibition
              by ciprofloxacin. Gyrase protection was proportional to the
              concentration of Qnr-His and inversely proportional to the
              concentration of ciprofloxacin. The protective activity of
              Qnr-His was lost by boiling the protein and involved neither
              quinolone inactivation nor independent gyrase activity.
              Protection of topoisomerase IV, a secondary target of quinolone
              action in , was not evident. How Qnr protects DNA gyrase and the
              prevalence of this resistance mechanism in clinical isolates
              remains to be determined.",
