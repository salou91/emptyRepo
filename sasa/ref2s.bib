  abstract  = "We study the structure of social networks of students by
               examining the graphs of Facebook ?friendships? at five U.S.
               universities at a single point in time. We investigate the
               community structure of each single-institution network and
               employ visual and quantitative tools, including standardized
               pair-counting methods, to measure the correlations between the
               network communities and a set of self-identified user
               characteristics (residence, class year, major, and high school).
               We review the basic properties and statistics of the employed
               pair-counting indices and recall, in simplified notation, a
               useful formula for the z-score of the Rand coefficient. Our
               study illustrates how to examine different instances of social
               networks constructed in similar environments, emphasizes the
               array of social forces that combine to form ?communities,? and
               leads to comparative observations about online social
               structures, which reflect offline social structures. We
               calculate the relative contributions of different
               characteristics to the community structure of individual
               universities and compare these relative contributions at
               different universities. For example, we examine the importance
               of common high school affiliation at large state universities
               and the varying degrees of influence that common major can have
               on the social structure at different universities. The
               heterogeneity of the communities that we observe indicates that
               university networks typically have multiple organizing factors
               rather than a single dominant one.",
