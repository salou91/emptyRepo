               in the hydrolysis of ATP. While bound to actin each cross-bridge
               undergoes a conformational change, often referred to as the
               ``power stroke'', which moves the actin filament past the myosin
               filaments; this is associated with the release of the products
               of ATP hydrolysis and a stronger binding of myosin to actin. The
               association of a new ATP molecule weakens the binding again, and
               the attached cross-bridge rapidly dissociates from actin. The
               nucleotide is then hydrolysed, the conformational change
               reverses, and the myosin cross-bridge reattaches to actin. X-ray
               crystallography has determined the structural basis of the power
               stroke, but it is still not clear why the binding of actin

               region that enables dimer formation through a coiled-coil, and a
               carboxy-terminal tail domain that binds light chains and

               psychological well-being. However, this greater visibility may
               come with increased risk of peer victimization. Being out,

               a model of risk and resilience for outness among LGBT youth,
               including whether it varies by community context. We tested our
               hypothesized model with a national dataset of 7,816 LGBT
               secondary school students using multi-group structural equation
               modeling. Consistent with our hypotheses, outness was related to
               higher victimization but also to higher self-esteem and lower
               depression. Greater victimization was related to negative
               academic outcomes directly and indirectly via diminished
               well-being. The increases in victimization associated with
               outness were larger for rural youth, and benefits to well-being

               article suggests that being out reflects resilience in the face
               of higher risk of victimization, in addition to promoting
               well-being in other ways. Nonetheless, contextual factors

               high-resolution proxy disciplines (trees, corals, ice cores and
               documentary evidence), emphasizing current issues in their use
               for climate reconstruction; the various approaches that have

               which current and new approaches to interpreting these proxy
               data may be rigorously assessed using pseudo-proxies derived
               from climate model runs, where the `answer' is known. The
               article concludes with a list of recommendations. First, more
               raw proxy data are required from the diverse disciplines and
               from more locations, as well as replication, for all proxy
               sources, of the basic raw measurements to improve absolute
               dating, and to better distinguish the proxy climate signal from
               noise. Second, more effort is required to improve the
               understanding of what individual proxies respond to, supported
               by more site measurements and process studies. These activities
               should also be mindful of the correlation structure of
               instrumental data, indicating which adjacent proxy records ought
               to be in agreement and which not. Third, large-scale climate
               reconstructions should be attempted using a wide variety of
               techniques, emphasizing those for which quantified errors can be
               estimated at specified timescales. Fourth, a greater use of
               climate model simulations is needed to guide the choice of
               reconstruction techniques (the pseudo-proxy concept) and
               possibly help determine where, given limited resources, future
               sampling should be concentrated.",

               ventilation and health. A similar multidisciplinary review of
               infant feeding mode in relation to allergy has not been
               published previously. Here, the objective is to review the
               scientific literature regarding the impact of early feeding
               (breast milk and/or cow's milk and/or formula) on development of
               atopic disease. The work was performed by a multidisciplinary
               group of Scandinavian researchers. METHODS: The search in the
               literature identified 4323 articles that contained at least one
               of the exposure and health effect terms. A total of 4191
               articles were excluded mainly because they did not contain
               information on both exposure and health effects. Consequently,
               132 studies have been scrutinized by this review group. RESULTS:
               Of the 132 studies selected, 56 were regarded as conclusive.
               Several factors contributed to the exclusions. The studies
               considered conclusive by the review group were categorized
               according to population and study design. CONCLUSIONS: The
               review group concluded that breastfeeding seems to protect from
               the development of atopic disease. The effect appears even
               stronger in children with atopic heredity. If breast milk is
               unavailable or insufficient, extensively hydrolysed formulas are
               preferable to unhydrolysed or partially hydrolysed formulas in
               terms of the risk of some atopic manifestations.",

  abstract  = "Humans and their ancestors are unique in being a fire-making
               species, but 'natural' (i.e. independent of humans) fires have
               an ancient, geological history on Earth. Natural fires have
               influenced biological evolution and global biogeochemical
               cycles, making fire integral to the functioning of some biomes.
               Globally, debate rages about the impact on ecosystems of
               prehistoric human-set fires, with views ranging from
               catastrophic to negligible. Understanding of the diversity of
               human fire regimes on Earth in the past, present and future
               remains rudimentary. It remains uncertain how humans have caused
               a departure from 'natural' background levels that vary with
               climate change. Available evidence shows that modern humans can
               increase or decrease background levels of natural fire activity
               by clearing forests, promoting grazing, dispersing plants,
               altering ignition patterns and actively suppressing fires,
               thereby causing substantial ecosystem changes and loss of
               biodiversity. Some of these contemporary fire regimes cause
               substantial economic disruptions owing to the destruction of
               infrastructure, degradation of ecosystem services, loss of life,
               and smoke-related health effects. These episodic disasters help
               frame negative public attitudes towards landscape fires, despite
               the need for burning to sustain some ecosystems. Greenhouse
               gas-induced warming and changes in the hydrological cycle may
               increase the occurrence of large, severe fires, with potentially
               significant feedbacks to the Earth system. Improved
               understanding of human fire regimes demands: (1) better data on
               past and current human influences on fire regimes to enable
               global comparative analyses, (2) a greater understanding of
               different cultural traditions of landscape burning and their
               positive and negative social, economic and ecological effects,
               and (3) more realistic representations of anthropogenic fire in
               global vegetation and climate change models. We provide an
               historical framework to promote understanding of the development
               and diversification of fire regimes, covering the pre-human
               period, human domestication of fire, and the subsequent
               transition from subsistence agriculture to industrial economies.
               All of these phases still occur on Earth, providing
               opportunities for comparative research.",

               to biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is presented.
               Secondly, recent trends in agricultural policies of the European
               Union that contribute to biodiversity decline in agricultural
               landscapes are considered. Three major processes responsible for
               creating biodiversity-related conflicts are described: the
               intensification of agriculture, the abandonment of marginally
               productive but High Nature Value Farmland, and the changing
               scale of agricultural operations. Conflicts created by these
               processes and approaches to their reconciliation are identified,
               emphasizing the need for monitoring as an integral part of
               conflict reconciliation strategies. A generic approach
               comprising three types of monitoring is developed for measuring
               success of reconciliation strategies: monitoring of the
               intensity of the conflict between stakeholders, of the social
               and economic effects on farmers, and of the status and trends in
               biodiversity. Surprisingly, we found no evidence in the
               literature that the first type of monitoring has ever been
               undertaken for biodiversity-related conflicts in agricultural
               landscapes. For each type of monitoring, suitable indicators are

               on Asthma (ARIA) was initiated during a World Health
               Organization workshop in 1999 (published in 2001). ARIA has
               reclassified AR as mild/moderate-severe and

               patients' needs and underlines the close relationship between
               rhinitis and asthma. Patients, clinicians, and other health care
               professionals are confronted with various treatment choices for

               the relative merits and downsides of the various treatment

               protein-coupled receptors, designated A1, A2A, A2B and A3 are
               currently known. In this study all human subtypes were stably
               transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in order to
               be able to study their pharmacological profile in an identical
               cellular background utilizing radioligand binding studies (A1,
               A2A, A3) or adenylyl cyclase activity assays (A2B). The A1
               subtype showed the typical pharmacological profile with
               2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) as the agonist with the
               highest affinity and a marked stereoselectivity for the
               N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) diastereomers. In competition
               with antagonist radioligand biphasic curves were observed for
               agonists. In the presence of GTP all receptors were converted to
               a single low affinity state indicating functional coupling to
               endogenous G proteins. For A2A adenosine receptors CGS 21680
               (2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadeno
               sine) and N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) were found to be
               the most potent agonists followed by R- and S-PIA with minor
               stereoselectivity. The relative potencies of agonists for the
               A2B adenosine receptor could only be tested by measurement of
               receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. NECA was the most
               potent agonist with an EC50-value of 2.3 microM whereas all
               other compounds tested were active at concentrations in the high
               micromolar range. Inhibition of NECA-stimulated adenylyl cyclase
               identified xanthine amino congener (XAC;
               8-[4-[[[[(2-aminoethyl)amino]-carbonyl]methyl]oxy]phenyl]-1,3-dipropylxa
               nthine) as the most potent antagonist at this receptor subtype.
               The A3 receptor was characterized utilizing the nonselective
               agonist [3H]NECA. The N6-benzyl substituted derivatives of
               adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (MECA) turned out to be the most
               potent agonists. The notion of xanthine-insensitivity of the A3
               receptor should be dropped at least for the human receptor as
               xanthines with submicromolar affinity were found. Overall, the
               pharmacological characteristics of the human receptors are
               similar to other species with some species-specific
               characteristics. In this study we present for the first time the
               comparative pharmacology of all known human adenosine receptor
               subtypes. The CHO cells with stably transfected adenosine
               receptors provide an identical cellular background for such a
               pharmacological characterization. These cells are valuable
               systems for further characterization of specific receptor

  abstract  = "Without robust and unbiased systems for monitoring, changes in
               natural systems will remain enigmatic for policy makers, leaving
               them without a clear idea of the consequences of any
               environmental policies they might adopt. Generally,
               biodiversity-monitoring activities are not integrated or
               evaluated across any large geographic region. The EuMon project
               conducted the first large-scale evaluation of monitoring
               practices in Europe through an on-line questionnaire and is
               reporting on the results of this survey. In September 2007 the
               EuMon project had documented 395 monitoring schemes for species,
               which represents a total annual cost of about 4 million euro,
               involving more than 46,000 persons devoting over 148,000
               person-days/year to biodiversity-monitoring activities. Here we
               focused on the analysis of variations of monitoring practices
               across a set of taxonomic groups (birds, amphibians and
               reptiles, mammals, butterflies, plants, and other insects) and
               across 5 European countries (France, Germany, Hungary,
               Lithuania, and Poland). Our results suggest that the overall
               sampling effort of a scheme is linked with the proportion of
               volunteers involved in that scheme. Because precision is a
               function of the number of monitored sites and the number of
               sites is maximized by volunteer involvement, our results do not
               support the common belief that volunteer-based schemes are too
               noisy to be informative. Just the opposite, we believe
               volunteer-based schemes provide relatively reliable data, with
               state-of-the-art survey designs or data-analysis methods, and
               consequently can yield unbiased results. Quality of data
               collected by volunteers is more likely determined by survey
               design, analytical methodology, and communication skills within
               the schemes rather than by volunteer involvement per se.",
