  abstract  = "g:Profiler (http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/) is a public web
               server for characterising and manipulating gene lists resulting
               from mining high-throughput genomic data. g:Profiler has a
               simple, user-friendly web interface with powerful visualisation
               for capturing Gene Ontology (GO), pathway, or transcription
               factor binding site enrichments down to individual gene levels.
               Besides standard multiple testing corrections, a new improved
               method for estimating the true effect of multiple testing over
               complex structures like GO has been introduced. Interpreting
               ranked gene lists is supported from the same interface with very
               efficient algorithms. Such ordered lists may arise when studying
               the most significantly affected genes from high-throughput data
               or genes co-expressed with the query gene. Other important
               aspects of practical data analysis are supported by modules
               tightly integrated with g:Profiler. These are: g:Convert for
               converting between different database identifiers; g:Orth for
               finding orthologous genes from other species; and g:Sorter for
               searching a large body of public gene expression data for
               co-expression. g:Profiler supports 31 different species, and
               underlying data is updated regularly from sources like the
               Ensembl database. Bioinformatics communities wishing to
               integrate with g:Profiler can use alternative simple textual
               outputs.",

               results from a PAGES/CLIVAR Intersection Panel meeting that took
               place in June 2006. The review is in three parts: the principal
               high-resolution proxy disciplines (trees, corals, ice cores and
               documentary evidence), emphasizing current issues in their use
               for climate reconstruction; the various approaches that have
               been adopted to combine multiple climate proxy records to
               provide estimates of past annual-to-decadal timescale Northern
               Hemisphere surface temperatures and other climate variables,
               such as large-scale circulation indices; and the forcing
               histories used in climate model simulations of the past
               millennium. We discuss the need to develop a framework through
               which current and new approaches to interpreting these proxy
               data may be rigorously assessed using pseudo-proxies derived
               from climate model runs, where the `answer' is known. The
               article concludes with a list of recommendations. First, more
               raw proxy data are required from the diverse disciplines and
               from more locations, as well as replication, for all proxy
               sources, of the basic raw measurements to improve absolute
               dating, and to better distinguish the proxy climate signal from
               noise. Second, more effort is required to improve the
               understanding of what individual proxies respond to, supported
               by more site measurements and process studies. These activities
               should also be mindful of the correlation structure of
               instrumental data, indicating which adjacent proxy records ought
               to be in agreement and which not. Third, large-scale climate
               reconstructions should be attempted using a wide variety of
               techniques, emphasizing those for which quantified errors can be
               estimated at specified timescales. Fourth, a greater use of
               climate model simulations is needed to guide the choice of
               reconstruction techniques (the pseudo-proxy concept) and
               possibly help determine where, given limited resources, future
               sampling should be concentrated.",

               allergy have been elaborated on the basis of state-of-the-art
               reviews of the scientific literature regarding pets and
               allergies, building dampness and health, and building
               ventilation and health. A similar multidisciplinary review of
               infant feeding mode in relation to allergy has not been
               published previously. Here, the objective is to review the
               scientific literature regarding the impact of early feeding
               (breast milk and/or cow's milk and/or formula) on development of
               atopic disease. The work was performed by a multidisciplinary
               group of Scandinavian researchers. METHODS: The search in the
               literature identified 4323 articles that contained at least one
               of the exposure and health effect terms. A total of 4191
               articles were excluded mainly because they did not contain
               information on both exposure and health effects. Consequently,
               132 studies have been scrutinized by this review group. RESULTS:
               Of the 132 studies selected, 56 were regarded as conclusive.
               Several factors contributed to the exclusions. The studies
               considered conclusive by the review group were categorized
               according to population and study design. CONCLUSIONS: The
               review group concluded that breastfeeding seems to protect from
               the development of atopic disease. The effect appears even
               stronger in children with atopic heredity. If breast milk is
               unavailable or insufficient, extensively hydrolysed formulas are
               preferable to unhydrolysed or partially hydrolysed formulas in
               terms of the risk of some atopic manifestations.",

  abstract  = "Humans and their ancestors are unique in being a fire-making
               species, but 'natural' (i.e. independent of humans) fires have
               an ancient, geological history on Earth. Natural fires have
               influenced biological evolution and global biogeochemical
               cycles, making fire integral to the functioning of some biomes.
               Globally, debate rages about the impact on ecosystems of
               prehistoric human-set fires, with views ranging from
               catastrophic to negligible. Understanding of the diversity of
               human fire regimes on Earth in the past, present and future
               remains rudimentary. It remains uncertain how humans have caused
               a departure from 'natural' background levels that vary with
               climate change. Available evidence shows that modern humans can
               increase or decrease background levels of natural fire activity
               by clearing forests, promoting grazing, dispersing plants,
               altering ignition patterns and actively suppressing fires,
               thereby causing substantial ecosystem changes and loss of
               biodiversity. Some of these contemporary fire regimes cause
               substantial economic disruptions owing to the destruction of
               infrastructure, degradation of ecosystem services, loss of life,
               and smoke-related health effects. These episodic disasters help
               frame negative public attitudes towards landscape fires, despite
               the need for burning to sustain some ecosystems. Greenhouse
               gas-induced warming and changes in the hydrological cycle may
               increase the occurrence of large, severe fires, with potentially
               significant feedbacks to the Earth system. Improved
               understanding of human fire regimes demands: (1) better data on
               past and current human influences on fire regimes to enable
               global comparative analyses, (2) a greater understanding of
               different cultural traditions of landscape burning and their
               positive and negative social, economic and ecological effects,
               and (3) more realistic representations of anthropogenic fire in
               global vegetation and climate change models. We provide an
               historical framework to promote understanding of the development
               and diversification of fire regimes, covering the pre-human
               period, human domestication of fire, and the subsequent
               transition from subsistence agriculture to industrial economies.
               All of these phases still occur on Earth, providing
               opportunities for comparative research.",
