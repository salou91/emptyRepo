              antiphage defense system. The phage-host interactions involving
              CRISPRs have been studied in experiments with selected bacterial
              or archaeal species and, computationally, in completely sequenced
              genomes. However, these studies do not allow one to take
              prokaryotic population diversity and phage-host interaction
              dynamics into account. This gap can be filled by using
              metagenomic data: in particular, the largest existing data set,
              generated from the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling expedition.
              The application of three publicly available CRISPR recognition
              programs to the Global Ocean metagenome produced a large
              proportion of false-positive results. To address this problem, a
              filtering procedure was designed. It resulted in about 200
              reliable CRISPR cassettes, which were then studied in detail. The
              repeat consensuses were clustered into several stable classes
              that differed from the existing classification. Short fragments
              of DNA similar to the cassette spacers were more frequently
              present in the same geographical location than in other locations
              (P, <0.0001). We developed a catalogue of elementary
              CRISPR-forming events and reconstructed the likely evolutionary
              history of cassettes that had common spacers. Metagenomic
              collections allow for relatively unbiased analysis of phage-host
              interactions and CRISPR evolution. The results of this study
              demonstrate that CRISPR cassettes retain the memory of the local
              virus population at a particular ocean location. CRISPR evolution
              may be described using a limited vocabulary of elementary events
              that have a natural biological interpretation.",

              in the 5' untranslated regions of eukaryotic messenger RNAs. Some
              uORFs have been shown to encode functional peptides involved in
              the translational regulation of the downstream main ORFs.
              Comparative genomic approaches have been employed in genome-wide
              searches for uORFs encoding bioactive peptides, and by comparing
              uORF sequences between a few selected species or among a small
              group of species, uORFs with conserved amino acid sequences have
              been identified in plants, mammals, and insects. Regulatory
              regions within uORF-encoded peptides that are involved in
              translational control are typically 10 to 20 amino acids long.
              Detection of homology between such short regions largely depends
              on the selection of species for comparison. To maximize the
              chances of identifying conserved uORFs with short conserved
              regions, we devised a novel algorithm for homology search among a
              large number of species and the automatic selection of uORFs
              conserved in a wide range of species. RESULTS: In the present
              study, we developed the BAIUCAS (BLAST-based algorithm for
              identification of uORFs with conserved amino acid sequences)
              method, and identified 18 novel Arabidopsis uORFs whose amino
              acid sequences are conserved across diverse eudicot species,
              which include uORFs not found in previous comparative genomic
              studies due to low sequence conservation among species.
              Therefore, BAIUCAS is a powerful method for the identification of
              uORFs with conserved sequences, and it is particularly useful for
              the detection of uORFs with a small number of conserved amino
              acid residues. CONTACT: onouchi@abs.agr.hokudai.ac.jp

              extensively used in laboratories to simulate field conditions, to
              identify mechanisms of injury, and to develop injury thresholds.
              In this paper, we place rats in different placement locations
              along the length of the shock tube i.e., inside, outside and near
              the exit, to examine the role of animal placement location (APL)
              on the biomechanical load experienced by the animal. We found
              that the biomechanical load on the brain and internal organs in
              the thoracic cavity (lungs, heart) varied significantly depending
              on the APL. When the specimen is positioned outside, organs in
              the thoracic cavity experience a higher pressure for a longer
              duration, in contrast to APL inside the shock tube. This in turn
              will possibly alter the injury type, severity and lethality. It
              is found that the optimal APL occurs where the Friedlander
              waveform is first formed way inside the shock tube. Once the
              optimal APL was determined, the effect of the incident blast
              intensity on the surface and intracranial pressure was measured
              and analyzed. Noticeably, surface and intracranial pressure
              scales linearly with the incident peak overpressures, though
              surface pressures are significantly higher than the other two.
              Further, we developed and validated an anatomically accurate
              finite element model of the rat head. With this model, we
              determined that the main pathway of pressure transmission to the
              brain was through the skull and not through the snout; however,
              snout plays a secondary role in diffracting the incoming blast

              it to identify a catalog of 991 phages targeted by CRISPR across
              all individuals. Our results show that 78\% of these phages are

              DNA, which is then likely degraded by Cas3 during CRISPR
              interference.ResultsWe describe how a CRISPR-activated E. coli

              New spacers are integrated directly downstream of the leader

              protospacers with an AAG protospacer adjacent motif, which is
              located directly upstream of the protospacer. A co-occurrence of
              PAM deviations and CRISPR repeat mutations was observed,

              to composite blast by silver staining. However, persistent
              gliosis in hippocampus and accumulation of GFAP/CNPase in
              circulation was detected after both primary and composite blast.
              Also, markers of vascular/endothelial inflammation integrin
              alpha/beta, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and
              L-selectin along with neurotrophic factor nerve growth
              factor-beta were increased in serum within 6 h post-blasts and
              persisted for 7 days thereafter. In contrast, systemic IL-1,
              IL-10, fractalkine, neuroendocrine peptide Orexin A, and VEGF
              receptor Neuropilin-2 (NRP-2) were raised predominantly after
              primary blast exposure. In conclusion, biomarkers of major
              pathological pathways were elevated at all blast set-ups. The
              most significant and persistent changes in neuro-glial markers
              were found after composite blast, while primary blast instigated
              prominent systemic cytokine/chemokine, Orexin A, and Neuropilin-2
              release, particularly when primary blast impacted rats with
